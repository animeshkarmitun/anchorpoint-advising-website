        {
            "question": "What is dual taxation and how does it affect me?",
            "answer": "Dual taxation occurs when income is taxed in both your country of residence and Bangladesh. Bangladesh has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) with several countries. We help you navigate these to avoid paying tax twice."

        {
            "question": "Is my rental income in Bangladesh taxable?",
            "answer": "Yes. Rental income from property in Bangladesh is taxable, and you must declare it in your tax return. We help calculate the correct tax liability and claim eligible deductions."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I send my documents securely?",
